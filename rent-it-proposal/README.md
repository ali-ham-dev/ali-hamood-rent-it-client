# Project Title

Rent It

## Overview

Rent It connects renters and rentees, offering a streamlined, automated workflow to empower users to transact with confidence.

### Problem Space

Rent It sets out to address two problems from two broad user categories.

First, suppose you purchased an essential asset but don't get much use out of it, making it feel like an unwise purchasing decision. This could be a tuxedo, a snow machine, construction tools, etc. You might also have made such purchases because you're an entrepreneur looking for opportunities. Whatever the circumstances may be, you have an asset and hope to earn a financial return on it.

Second, suppose you need an asset for some period of time, or you are looking for a low-cost, low-risk way of accessing an asset. This could be seasonal decorations (e.g., Christmas decorations), a tuxedo, uncommon machinery, etc.

This is where Rent It shines! Rent It offers a space where both renters and rentees can transact in an efficient user friendly environment. This workflow include procedural wizards automating the process, such process may include advertising, questionnaires, messaging and texting, document sharing, contract establishment, cellphone based inspections, financial transaction brokering, and possibly more. 

### User Profile
