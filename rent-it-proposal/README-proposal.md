# Project Title

Rent It

## Overview

Rent It connects renters and rentees, offering a streamlined, automated workflow to empower users to transact with confidence.

### Problem Space

Rent It sets out to address two problems from two broad user categories.

First, suppose you purchased an essential asset but don't get much use out of it, making it feel like an unwise purchasing decision. This could be a tuxedo, a snow machine, construction tools, etc. You might also have made such purchases because you're an entrepreneur looking for opportunities. Whatever the circumstances may be, you have an asset and hope to earn a financial return on it.

Second, suppose you need an asset for some period of time, or you are looking for a low-cost, low-risk way of accessing an asset. This could be seasonal decorations (e.g., Christmas decorations), a tuxedo, netch machinery, or etc.

This is where Rent It shines! Rent It offers a space where both renters and rentees can transact in an efficent user freindly environemnt. Rent It provides various workflows tailored to each asset class to make renting as painless and easy as possible. These workflows include procedural wizards automating the process, such process may include advertising, questionnaires, video calls and texting, credit checks, contract establishment, cellphone based inspections,shipping and handling services, asset insurance, dispute arbitration, financial transaction brokering, and may more.

### APIs

- Currently, the offering does not anticipate the need for a publicly accessible API.
- The app will implement strongly typed backend packages as a RESTful API strictly for use by the app.
- How many APIs and how will they look together. 

### Sitemap

List the pages of your app with brief descriptions. You can show this visually, or write it out.

### Mockups

Provide visuals of your app's screens. You can use pictures of hand-drawn sketches, or wireframing tools like Figma.

### Endpoints

List endpoints that your server will implement, including HTTP methods, parameters, and example responses.

## Roadmap

Scope your project as a sprint. Break down the tasks that will need to be completed and map out timeframes for implementation working back from the capstone due date.

## Future Implementations
Your project will be marked based on what you committed to in the above document. Here, you can list any additional features you may complete after the MVP of your application is built, or if you have extra time before the Capstone due date.
